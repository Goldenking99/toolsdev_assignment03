The inspiration of this project came from this initial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cr0gDbN9OA 
Many days were spent writing and planning out the logic the person used in that video and then an attempt was set forward to try and recreate the work along with adding my own spin to the
project. After many failed attempts with my original code and with time running short, I had stumbled across this guide: https://github.com/stevenquinn/CityGen
The guide fit the bill for everything I was hoping to accomplish in my original task and so I setforth attaching it to a PySide2 GUI and implement the automatic save function.
I made adjustments to this person's code to follow naming convention standards and also cleaned up the structure of the code. I DO NOT CLAIM ANY OWNERSHIP OVER ANY OF THE CODE! 
While adjustments to code structure and variables have been renamed to follow naming standards, the code is still the intellectual property of the original creator! I understand
in doing this doesn't count as two of the features (unless the PySdie2 GUI customization still counts) and that I also did not include the tutorial with my proposal.

I hope to revisit this assignment and create a portfolio worthy piece in the future from my original attempt, and possibly add some zone structure that would influence certain
building structure code (such as houses for residental, parks and trees for recreational zones, etc.)
